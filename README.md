# Z80 Testing Software for Z80-MBC2

this is the port to the Z80-MBC2, you can find the original repository here:

https://github.com/skiselev/z80-tests

Since the Z80-MBC2 has no SIO-Chip it needs another possibility for a scratch byte. I added this functionality to the IOS on the ATMega32, so you also need to flash this IOS:

# Zilog Z80 and Compatibles Testing Software

## z80type

**z80type** tests the Z80 CPU type. Currently it is able to distinguish between NMOS CPUs, CMOS CPUs, and U880 CPUs.

**z80type** runs under the CP/M or ZSDOS OSes. It uses SIO interrupt vector register as a scratch register for tests. By default the code is configured to run on RC2014* SIO module or on Small Computer Central RCBus modules, such as [SC725 â€“ RCBus Serial and Timer Module](https://smallcomputercentral.com/sc725-rcbus-serial-and-timer-module/).
If running on different systems, modify the SIOBC constant in the code to point to the SIO Channel B control register, and rebuild the code.

### Building z80type

The code is written using CP/M ASM syntax and can be compiled as follows:

```
A>ASM Z80TYPE
A>LOAD Z80TYPE
```

### Example z80type Output

Please refer to [Results.md](Results.md) for the example output of z80type running on various CPUs.

Here is an example of running to on an original Zilog Z84C0010PEG CPUs:

```
A>Z80TYPE /D
